# UniConnect 🎓

> An all-in-one academic management platform that combines Google Classroom, Google Drive, and WhatsApp into a unified web experience.

## 📌 Overview

Managing college courses shouldn't require juggling 5+ different apps. UniConnect consolidates course announcements, materials, assignments, group chats, and calendars into one seamless platform designed specifically for academic workflows.

Built as our Database Systems course project, UniConnect addresses the common frustration of switching between Google Classroom, Drive, WhatsApp, and various calendar apps just to stay on top of coursework.
